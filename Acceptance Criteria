✅ Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are a set of predefined conditions that a feature or functionality must meet to be accepted by stakeholders or considered “done.” They are a critical part of Requirement Analysis because they provide a clear, shared understanding of expectations between developers, testers, and clients.

🔎 Why Acceptance Criteria Matter:
✅ Clarify Requirements: Define exactly what needs to be built.

✅ Guide Development: Developers know what functionality and behaviors to implement.

✅ Enable Testing: Testers can verify that the feature works as expected.

✅ Prevent Misunderstandings: Ensure all stakeholders are aligned on feature scope.
