Requirement Analysis

📌 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and clearly defined. This process ensures that all parties involved — including developers, designers, testers, and clients — have a shared understanding of what the software must accomplish.

🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
Requirement Gathering: Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.

Requirement Elicitation: Clarifying and refining requirements using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and use cases.

Requirement Documentation: Creating formal documents that describe functional and non-functional requirements.

Requirement Validation: Confirming with stakeholders that the documented requirements are correct, complete, and feasible.

Requirement Modeling: Representing requirements through diagrams and models to improve clarity and understanding.

💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important in SDLC?
✅ Defines Project Scope: Sets clear boundaries for what the system will and won’t do.

✅ Aligns Stakeholders: Ensures that all parties agree on project goals and expectations.

✅ Guides Development: Provides developers with a clear roadmap to build the right solution.

✅ Reduces Risk: Helps identify potential issues early, saving time and cost later.

✅ Prevents Scope Creep: Avoids uncontrolled changes that can derail the project.

✅ Improves Quality: Leads to software that meets user needs and performs reliably.

In summary, Requirement Analysis is not just the starting point — it’s the foundation of any successful software project.
